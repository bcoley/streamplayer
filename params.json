The swing gui needs work, \r\n    but it does all mostly function, and can deal with m3u style playlists.   \r\n\r\n    ChristmasStreamer - StreamPlayer extended with a Christmas theme.\r\n\r\nThe channels I listen to a lot are preloaded in, but you can of course enter your own favorite \r\nmusic stream urls to listen to.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
