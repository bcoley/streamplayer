streamplayer
============

Java Application for playing audio streams - visualizations, lyrics, images and more


The main classes to run - 

    StreamPlayer - plays streams with visualizations and lyrics etc.

    FilePlayer - like StreamPlayer but for local files.   The swing gui needs work, 
    but it does all mostly function, and can deal with m3u style playlists.   

    ChristmasStreamer - StreamPlayer extended with a Christmas theme.

The channels I listen to a lot are preloaded in, but you can of course enter your own favorite 
music stream urls to listen to.
